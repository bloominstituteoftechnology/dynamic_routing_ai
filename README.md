# dynamic_routing_ai

## TLDR

A simple set of queries to indicate how to route queries to different sources.

### What is this, really?

How do you query from different sources depending on the query question. This is just one way to go about it. There may be other ways.

### What do I need?

The ability to create Docker containers and pull from Docker Hub.

An OpenAI key, which yes means you have to have a credit card. You can get an OpenAI key[here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

If you would like to see how your agents are performing, you can also create a Langchain account. We're not doing that here.
